On a scale of 1 to 5, I give this code a rating of 5   based on the following criteria:

1  The program has syntax errors and does not compile, or the project does not provide sufficient information to install necessary dependencies.
2  The program compiles successfully but generates runtime errors. or the project does not contain sufficeint instructions to run the program.
3  The program compiles and runs but does not perform correctly and does not produce correct results
4  The program compiles and produces correct output but does not follow assignment/class guidelines or is insufficiently documented
5  The program produces correct output and is well written and well documented

Suggestions for improving the project:
I don't really have any suggestions for improvement. Their program does exactly how thy said it would. Just didn't get to see how the point system would work.
