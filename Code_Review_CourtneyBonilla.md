On a scale of 1 to 5, I give this code a rating of 5 based on the following criteria:

1  The program has syntax errors and does not compile, or the project does not provide sufficient information to instal necessary dependencies.
2  The program compiles successfully but generates runtime errors. or the project does not contain sufficeint instructions to run the program.
3  The program compiles and runs but does not perform correctly and does not produce correct results
4  The program compiles and produces correct output but does not follow assignment/class guidelines or is insufficiently documented
5  The program produces correct output and is well written and well documented

Suggestions for improving the project:

 I think its cool that this project isn't just a class project, but something that could be useful to Chapman. As far as your code, it looks really nice, easily readible, and it compiles and runs. I think you should make it to print a little nicer maybe? I think its fine now, but I always find it easier to find elements when they're listed downwards. Also, this code is much more complex than anything I have ever written, so I think more detailed comments are a plus! Good job!
