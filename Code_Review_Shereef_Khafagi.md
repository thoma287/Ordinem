On a scale of 1 to 5, I give this code a rating of 5 based on the following criteria:

1  The program has syntax errors and does not compile, or the project does not provide sufficient information to install necessary dependencies.
2  The program compiles successfully but generates runtime errors. or the project does not contain sufficeint instructions to run the program.
3  The program compiles and runs but does not perform correctly and does not produce correct results
4  The program compiles and produces correct output but does not follow assignment/class guidelines or is insufficiently documented
5  The program produces correct output and is well written and well documented

Suggestions for improving the project:
When I followed the README.md instructions I only received "Not found (object). However when I went to ordinem.ddns.net/api.php/students
and searched for myself using ctrl+f, I found that I wasn't in the database. This is my first semester at the school so maybe I'm
not in this version? However when I picked a random ID from the database and added it to the end of the address the students showed up
so I see no reason to not give a 5. The program does as it should and follows the guidelines. There's a lot of code so a bit more
documentation might help for the reviewers. Overall a job well done!
