On a scale of 1 to 5, I give this code a rating of 5 based on the following criteria:

1  The program has syntax errors and does not compile, or the project does not provide sufficient information to instal necessary dependencies.
2  The program compiles successfully but generates runtime errors. or the project does not contain sufficeint instructions to run the program.
3  The program compiles and runs but does not perform correctly and does not produce correct results
4  The program compiles and produces correct output but does not follow assignment/class guidelines or is insufficiently documented
5  The program produces correct output and is well written and well documented

Suggestions for improving the project:

Right now the site displays only PHP after the login screen, but I'm sure you guys are aware of that.
My only suggestion would be to continue finished that up, because your java skeleton code looks AWESOME.
